## Game description
A simple programming task #1: "A fighter and a missile"

The task is to create a simple 3rd person flying "game" with the free store assets linked below.

We leave the specific details to you, but the demo should include at least the following three things:
1) The player must be able to control the fighter ship in 3D space (with a 3rd person camera view following the ship).
2) The player must be able to target-lock onto the asteroid (by pressing a key) with some kind of visual indicator/HUD.
3) The player must be able to fire a HOMING missile (by pressing a key), which flies at and collides with the asteroid regardless of the orientation of the ship.


Things we will be evaluating are:
- Overall code quality and clarity.
- Visual style of the demo, and any possible extras such as particle effects or shaders etc.
- Any polish and extra features that may be present.


We estimate that the task should take between 2 and 8 hours, but it is really up to you. You are free to use other (free) assets from the Unity Asset Store - just remember to mention these in your submission so that we can focus on evaluating your work specifically.

We claim no rights on the finished project; you are free to include it as part of your own portfolio.
